**Important (Ethics & legality):**  
This repository contains **consent-based** demos only. These scripts log input only when the user runs them and consents. They do NOT capture system-wide keystrokes or run stealthily. Do not use or deploy keylogging tools without explicit permission.

## Included demos
- `consensual_logger.py` — terminal program that logs entered lines to a timestamped file after user consent.
- `gui_logger.py` — Tkinter GUI that logs keys while the app is focused and allows saving the log.

## How to run
See individual run instructions inside each demo file and below in `submission_instructions.txt`.
